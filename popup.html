		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		<p>Setup a shortcut that will open the command bar. Find the tab search extension and setup any shortcut that you like. Remember that some shortcuts reserved for Chrome (like Ctrl+T, or Ctrl+W) cannot be used. Ctrl+E is a great one since it's current binding isn't very useful (and also bound to Ctrl+K). Configure your shortcut <a href="chrome://extensions/configureCommands" target="_blank">here</a></p>
		<h1>Options</h1>
		<p>A search is performed by default after at least 3 characters have been typed. You can change this behavior by selecting the number of characters before performing a query below.
			<input type="number" min="1" />
		<h1>Hints</h1>
		<p>There are some things you should know about to help you out, they are listed below</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="tab.png" /></td>
				<td>The tab icon means that this result is from a currently open tab. Press enter when highlighted to focus on that tab</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="link.png" /></td>
				<td>The tab with a plus means it is some sort of link and will open in a new tab if selected</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="glass.png" /></td>
				<td>If no search results are found in open tabs or bookmarks, the magnifying glass appears. Pressing enter will perform a Google search on the current term in a new tab</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="option.png" /></td>
				<td>Some results will have additional options that appear as buttons in the corner. You can click on them to execute the operation</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><div class="shortcut">Ctrl+backspace</div></td>
				<td>Control+Backspace is a shortcut that will perform the additional option without needing to click on it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><div class="shortcut">Ctrl+Enter<div></td>
				<td>Control+Enter will perform a Google websearch on the term regardless of whether or not there are results</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><div class="shortcut">Esc<div></td>
				<td>Escape will close the command bar</td>
			</tr>
